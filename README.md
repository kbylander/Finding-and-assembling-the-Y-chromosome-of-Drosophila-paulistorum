We got data and full genome assemblies from [here](https://github.com/mmontonerin/ComparativeGenomics_Dpaulistorum/tree/main/00_Assembly) \
Note: Currently (2022-12-20) not all data is publicly available.

This repository accompanies the final report which you can read [here](https://github.com/kbylander/Finding-and-assembling-the-Y-chromosome-of-Drosophila-paulistorum/wiki/Report).
